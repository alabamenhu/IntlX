CLASS X::SecurityPolicy::Eval
The SlurpySentry referenced is an internal role, however it is unused.
Simply use $.payload.Str instead, which is what CORE should have.

CLASS X::AdHoc
The SlurpySentry referenced is an old internal role, nowadays unused.
Most languages should simply use '$.payload.Str' as the entire method,
which is what CORE should probably do as well.

CLASS X::ControlFlow::Return
Use $.out-of-dynamic-scope instead of $!out-of-dynamic-scope in translations
